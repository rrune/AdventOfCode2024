My solutions for Advent of Code 2024. Go isn't really that suited for it I guess. Limits are my abilities though. My goal is to hopefully complete everything. I don't compete on any leaderbord and usually never look back at the mess I created as soon as the output is correct.
  
To run:
    1) don't
    2) put your inputs in the respective directory, name it 'input.txt'
    3) go run main.go
    4) pray
    5) usually edit code to get results for part 1 and realize you should've used a different repo :)
